# 1. Test Battery Storage System
This is a test fixture for Sonnen Battery Storage Systems.
## - Steps
1. Install python virtual environment
```bash
    python -m venv venv 
```
2. Source the created virtual environment
```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install requirements
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run test cases and check created logs inside the logs folder
```bash
    pytest test_storage_system.py
```

# 2. Fibonacci sequence
```python
def fibonacci_generator():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Example usage:
fib = fibonacci_generator()

# Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(fib))

```

# 3. Advantages of pytest fixtures over setup and teardown methods.
 For me, I think pytest fixture introduces perfection into testing. This is established through 
multiple options such as the parameters that can be passed, the different ways you could trigger 
them mark and use fixture or auto use. They may have scope so setup and teardown run before all tests and after all test 
Instead of before and after each test. In general, Pytest fixtures are reusable, modular, and support automatic cleanup. They offer flexible scope and better separation of concerns compared to setup/teardown methods, making tests easier to maintain.

# 4. Integrate of Machine Learning in a hardware-dependent test automation
To integrate Machine Learning into a hardware-dependent test automation framework, you could use ML to make the testing process smarter and more efficient. First, you'd collect real-time data from the hardware, like system logs or performance metrics. ML could then help spot anomalies in how the hardware behaves during tests, identifying issues early. Over time, the system could learn from past tests to predict potential failures, so you can focus on the areas most likely to cause problems. ML can even suggest which tests to run next based on whatâ€™s happened before, optimizing the process and reducing unnecessary testing. This approach makes testing more proactive and targeted, saving time and catching issues that might otherwise be overlooked.
